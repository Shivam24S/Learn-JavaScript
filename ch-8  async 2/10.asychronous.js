// functions running in parallel with other functions are called asynchronous

// asynchronous function are taking some time to complete

// With asynchronous programming, JavaScript programs can start long-running tasks, and continue running other tasks in parallel.

// But, asynchronous programmes are difficult to write and difficult to debug.

// Because of this, most modern asynchronous JavaScript methods don't use callbacks. Instead, in JavaScript, asynchronous programming is solved using Promises instead.
