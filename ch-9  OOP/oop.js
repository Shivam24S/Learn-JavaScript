// Object-Oriented Programming is a programming style based on classes and objects. These group data (properties) and methods (actions) inside a box.

// OOP was developed to make code more flexible and easier to maintain.

// JavaScript is prototype-based procedural language, which means it supports both functional and object-oriented programming.

// 4 oop principle for class design

// 1.abstraction => Abstraction means hiding certain details that don't matter to the user and only showing essential features or functions.
// example of this
// FrontCamOn() , FrontCamOFF() , => front Camera

// 2.encapsulation =>Encapsulation means keeping properties and methods private inside a class, so that they are not accessible from outside that class. 

// 3.inheritance => we access parent class properties and methods

// 4.polymorphism => Polymorphism means having different and many forms. We can overwrite a method inherited from a parent class
